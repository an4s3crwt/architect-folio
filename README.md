Description
Ana's Secret is a portfolio created with Next.js, featuring a minimalist and avant-garde design. The site showcases a vertical scrolling collection of images, overlaid with a stylized SVG design that evokes brutalist architecture.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with modern web technologies like Next.js and SVG, and reflects my interest in unique interface design.
